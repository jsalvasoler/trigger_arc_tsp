abstract = {Activity-based scheduling optimization is a combinatorial problem built on the traveling salesman problem intending to optimize people schedules considering their trips and the available transportation network. Due to the difficulty of scheduling, traditional and exact methods are unable to provide appropriate solutions. Hence, new approaches have been introduced in the literature to settle these complex problems. One group of new techniques is known as metaheuristic algorithms, which provides a robust family of problem-solving methods created by mimicking natural phenomena. Although these new techniques might not find an optimal solution, they can find a near-optimal one in a moderate period. Furthermore, a myriad of novel algorithms has been introduced making it tedious for academics to select the appropriate technique. Thus, this paper investigates the contribution of metaheuristics to solve transportation-related optimization problems. To achieve this aim, we conducted a bibliometric analysis, and defined the descriptive and assessment features for 120 metaheuristics. The findings of the study reveal the usage tendencies of the algorithms, identify the most prevalent ones, and highlight those metaheuristics that have a potential use in upcoming research. The results demonstrate that the most applied metaheuristic algorithm is the genetic algorithm, but the ant colony optimization algorithm is the most popular one based on the number of citations. Lastly, we open a discussion on a few unexplored research gaps and expectations.}

abstract = {The Time Dependent (TD) Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a generalization of the TSP which allows one to take traffic conditions into account when planning tours in an urban context, by making the travel time between locations dependent on the departure time instead of being constant. The TD-TSPTW further generalizes this problem by adding Time Window constraints. Existing exact approaches such as Integer Linear Programming and Dynamic Programming usually do not scale well. We therefore introduce a new exact approach based on an anytime extension of A*. We combine this approach with local search, to converge faster towards better solutions, and bounding and time window constraint propagation, to prune parts of the state space. We experimentally compare our approach with state-of-the-art approaches on both TD-TSPTW and TSPTW benchmarks.}

The performance of tabu search is compared to the K-OPT procedure using six test problems drawn from the literature. Although K-OPT is not the fastest TSP solution method, it is widely recognized as a performance benchmark. The primary features of both the tabu search and K-OPT computer programs are described. Additional comments about tabu search in general and some factors which influence the performance of tabu search are provided.}
